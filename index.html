            <h4 class="text">About me</h4>
            <p class="text">My name is Roberto Hernandez-Sanchez and I live in Pennsylvania, but I am originally from Mexico. I moved to the USA when I was 9 years old, so technically most of my life has been here in the states. Currently, I am a High School/Middle School Spanish teacher. The reason I wanted to pursue this MEd in ITLS is because I like to create and design things to improve my teaching as well as incorporating the newest trends in technology for the classroom. This portfolio will showcase some of the skills and programs that I have learned so far.</p>
